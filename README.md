# OnTheBall

On the ball is a social networking / sporting event application. It was developed using Python, OpenWeather API, and MapBox API.
Users can make an account inputting some basic information and from there you will have full access to the site.
You can search for specific sporting events or create your own event.
Viewing someone's profile will show you some basic information about them like their name and location and will let you see the events that user has created.
Viewing a sporting event will show you the event's details, the geographical location using MapBox, and the current weather in that area using OpenWeather.
Each sporting event has its own comment section at the bottom of the page for users to interact with each other.
